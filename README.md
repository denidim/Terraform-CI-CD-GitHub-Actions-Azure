# Terraform-CI-CD-GitHub-Actions-Azure

## Now we will upload the Terraform configuration from the previous task (for provisioning Azure resources and deploying the "TaskBoard" Web app to Azure Web Apps) to GitHub and will use GitHub Actions workflows to test and run the configuration.

### By combining Terraform with GitHub Actions, we can automate the infrastructure provisioning process, ensure consistency, and integrate it into your CI/CD workflows, promoting efficient software delivery and reducing manual tasks. It provides a streamlined and efficient workflow for managing infrastructure as code, making it easier to maintain, test, and deploy your infrastructure resources.

### We will have GitHub Actions workflows that will provision the Azure resources we want
